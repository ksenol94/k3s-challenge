Local Kubernetes (K3s) DevOps Infrastructure

This project automates the setup of a local Kubernetes (K3s) cluster using OpenTofu (Terraform), Helm, Jenkins, Postgre and Redis.

I used ChatGPT Pro Plan for helper AI Tool.

Overview

-	Automates K3s master and worker node setup via Terraform and shell scripts.
-	Deploys PostgreSQL, Redis, and Jenkins using Helm charts.
-	Secrets and passwords are securely passed through terraform.tfvars.
-	Includes CLI test scripts for validating system health and external connectivity.
-	Provides a cleanup workflow for complete teardown and re-deployment.

Requirements

-	Ubuntu virtual machines (1 master minimum).
-	SSH key for accessing VMs.
-	OpenTofu (Terraform) for infrastructure provisioning.
-	kubectl and Helm CLI for Kubernetes management.
-	psql and redis-cli for external connection testing.
-	Optional: Multipass or VirtualBox for VM creation.

Infrastructure Setup

Preparation Scripts

-   install_master.tf and install_workers.tf files executing install script in right order.
-	prepare_ubuntu.sh updates the system, disables swap and firewall, sets up DNS, and installs Helm.
-	install_k3s_master.sh installs the K3s master node, configures API.
-	install_k3s_worker.sh joins the worker node to the cluster using the master join token.
-	Token and kubeconfig management scripts (fetch_kubeconfig.sh, create_or_refresh_token.sh, wait_for_token.sh) automate authentication setup.

Helm Deployments

-	PostgreSQL is deployed using a scheduled backup job and utilizes a local PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) for storage.
-	Redis is deployed with persistence and NodePort access for external connectivity.
-	Jenkins is deployed as a CI/CD server with Kubernetes integration and preinstalled plugins.
-	All Helm charts are stored under modules/helm/charts/ and follow best-practice structure.

Challenge Requirement Coverage

-	All resources are managed via Git.
-	Shell scripts handle installation and dependencies. Scripts like prepare_ubuntu.sh, install_k3s_master.sh, and install_k3s_worker.sh automate setup from scratch.
-	Fully reproducible on clean Ubuntu VMs. The entire cluster can be recreated on fresh Ubuntu instances with a single tofu apply.
-	Kubernetes (K3s) cluster provisioned via Terraform (OpenTofu). Both master and worker nodes are provisioned automatically through Terraform modules and scripts.
-	Applications deployed via Helm charts. PostgreSQL, Redis, and Jenkins are deployed using well-structured Helm charts.
-	Redis persistence and external access. Redis is accessible externally through NodePort and data is stored persistently on local-path volumes managed by the cluster.
-	PostgreSQL persistence with PVC. PostgreSQL data is stored persistently on local-path volumes managed by the cluster.
-	Jenkins deployed and externally accessible. Jenkins is deployed via Helm and reachable through NodePort, ready for future pipeline integration.
-	No plain-text secrets. Sensitive credentials (database and Jenkins admin passwords) are securely passed via terraform.tfvars using Helm’s set_sensitive.
-	CLI test scripts implemented. Scripts verify the health and connectivity of PostgreSQL, Redis, and Jenkins:
-	infra-check.sh checks overall infrastructure status (Pods, PVCs, Services).

Test Scripts with details and usage
-   infra-check.sh > This script automatically validates the health and accessibility of Redis, PostgreSQL, and Jenkins deployments—retrieving all required credentials and connection details dynamically from the project’s terraform.tfvars file—and can be executed locally or in Jenkins with a single command in manuel-test-scripts folder,

chmod +x infra-check.sh && ./infra-check.sh

-   test_postgres.sh > This script verifies that the PostgreSQL service deployed via Terraform and Helm is reachable, correctly configured, and actively generating backups inside its persistent volume.
-	test_redis.sh → Verifies Redis connectivity, authentication, data persistence (SET/GET), and NodePort accessibility using credentials from terraform.tfvars.
-	test_jenkins.sh → Validates Jenkins’ external availability, authentication endpoint, and Kubernetes resource status with credentials dynamically loaded from terraform.tfvars.
  
 Not Yet Implemented (Ongoing)
 -	Jenkins pipeline configuration. Jenkins is deployed and accessible, but pipeline setup and automated build triggers have not been implemented yet.

Summary

This project delivers a secure, fully automated, and reproducible DevOps infrastructure on Kubernetes (K3s).
From VM preparation to service validation, every stage—setup, testing, and cleanup—is fully automated using Terraform, Helm, and shell scripting.
